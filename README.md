# 👋 Hi, I’m Emily

I am a **computing science** student at Simon Fraser University. 🦝

Making pretty websites is my *passion*. I'm currently expanding my knowledge on HTML semantics beyond divs! 🤭

If I'm not coding, I'm doing one or more of the following:

- Starting Projects ✏️
- Eating food 🍲
- Drawing silly characters 🪿

eMongoose/eMongoose is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
